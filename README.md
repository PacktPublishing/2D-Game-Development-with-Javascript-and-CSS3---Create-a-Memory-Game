## About the Video Course
In this course, you'll learn how to build a randomized, dynamic 2D memory game with a timer, scorecard, and a customized result display from the ground up with just HTML5, JavaScript, and CSSS and using 2D game development conceptsâ€”all in just a couple of hours. 
In this course you will learn 
How to build a completely randomized, intelligent 2D memory game with stellar design with JavaScript, HTML5, and CSS3
How to design game logic for games and implement it as code
How to make the game intelligent and interesting by introducing a randomization element into it and making it unpredictable even for the programmer
How to set up the skeleton of a web app or web game using HTML5
How to design a sophisticated 2D game using advanced CSS and CSS3 concepts
How to make a 2D game playable using JavaScript concepts
How to build a fully featured timer for your game
How to make CSS3 card flipping work using CSS3 transitions and CSS3 transformations.
Logical problem solving
How to create completely customized popup boxes (you can use this knowledge in a number of other projects as well)
How to build a score display for your game that dynamically updates itself.
How 2D game development works on the web (with JavaScript and HTML5)
The basics of HTML5 & CSS3 (I'll explain the concepts as we code the project)
The basics of JavaScript (we have separate modules for this topic)
Front-end design and development
By the end of the course, you'll be one step closer to creating web-based 2D games and front-end web apps like a pro. You could even try creating other web apps and games from the concepts you learn in this course.
